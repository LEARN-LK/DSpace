## Step 1: Create an ORCID Sandbox Account (For Testing)

To try out ORCID integration without affecting any real data, you‚Äôll first need a **Sandbox ORCID iD**.

###  Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Visit the registration page**:
   Go to [https://sandbox.orcid.org/register](https://sandbox.orcid.org/register)

2. **Fill in your details**:
   Enter your name, email, and create a password.

3. **Skip the employment info (optional)**:
   If your organization isn‚Äôt listed (e.g., LEARN), just click the ‚Äú**Skip this step without adding an affiliation**‚Äù link.

4. **Set visibility preferences**:
   You‚Äôll be asked who can see your ORCID profile items. You can choose:

   * Everyone (recommended for testing)
   * Trusted parties
   * Only me

5. **Verify your email**:
   ORCID will send you a verification email. Click the link in that email to activate your account.
   *(Check spam/junk if you don‚Äôt see it right away.)*

## üîó Step 2: Link Your ORCID ID with DSpace (Demo Site)

Once your ORCID Sandbox account is ready, now let‚Äôs connect it to DSpace.

###  Steps:

   For example: [https://demo7.dspace.org/](https://demo7.dspace.org/)

2. **Log in or register**:
   Use any test account. (You can create one if needed.)

3. **Go to your profile/account settings**:
   Click on your username at the top right ‚Üí select **My Profile** or **Account Settings**.

4. **Look for ORCID connection**:
   You‚Äôll see a button like **‚ÄúConnect your ORCID iD‚Äù**.

5. **Authorize access**:
   You‚Äôll be redirected to the ORCID site.
   Log in using your **sandbox account**, and allow permission to connect it with DSpace.
